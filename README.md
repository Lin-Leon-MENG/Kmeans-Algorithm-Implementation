# Kmeans & Kmeans++ implementation and application

### Overview:
The goal of this project is to implement the kmeans algorithm from scratch, then apply to image compression. The report discusses about some of details and path I've taken to accomplish the goal. 

The source code is in the _kmeans.py_ file, we import it here to present some of the examples and results.
